# Anagram-Generator

A tool to generate anagrams from input text

## Explaining the code

In this program, the `generate_anagrams` function takes a `text` parameter, which is the input text that should be used to generate anagrams. The function uses the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module that was imported to generate all possible permutations of the input text.

The function then removes duplicates and the original text from the list of permutations, and returns the unique permutations as a list.

A new function was later called `find_meaningful_words` which takes the list of anagrams generated by `generate_anagrams` and returns a new list containing only the meaningful words.

## What to do

See the comment inside the `generate_anagrams` function on what to do. Your console should be similar to the attached screenshot below
